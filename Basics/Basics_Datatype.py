# Data Type

a = 'shubham tripathi'
name ="ram"
print (name)

b = 12.3
print(b)

c = 10
x = 'shyam'
print(x)

x = y =z = 1
print(x,y,z)

a , b, c = 'shubham ' , 30 , 33
print(a,b,c)

# Dynamically typed language

### Note that this Python variable is simply a refrncing value to a data
### for example (x = 25)
### here variable type also become integer type because variable is just a refrnce to the value
x = 23  #integer type
print (x)
print(type(x))
x = 12.3 # float type
print (12.3)
x = 'ram ' # string type
print (x)
### now we can say that the variable are the dynamically typed language

### <!-- I am declaring a variable X.
### Just declaration is not allowed in Python.
### You must initialize also.
### So I'm assigning value 25.
### So this is value.
### 25 is assign. -->

## type()
### print(type(x))


x = 23  #integer type
print (x)
print(type(x))


b = 12.3
print(b)
print(type(b))

c = 10
print(x)
print(type(c))

x = y =z = 1
print(x,y,z)
print(type(y))

a , b, c = 'shubham ' , 30 , 33
print(a,b,c)
print(type(a))




##### So yes, this is a integer type value.
#### Then what does it mean by class here?
##### Now one important thing, the foremost and the very, very, very important thing is that everything
#### in Python is an object.
#### So it's having its class.
#### So this int type is nothing but a class.
#### So the value 25 is an object of this int class.
#### So this variable x is of type class int.
##### I will just print the variable once I will show you.
##### Now you can see that it's showing value 25 only now that same variable x I will assign 12.3.
##### Then if I print x you can see that it will print value 12.3.
##### Now I will say again type X, what is the type of x?
#### Now the class for that x has changed.
#### Now x is float type.
#### Variable name is same x, but the type has changed.
#### How the type is decided.
#### It is decided based on.
#### The value that I have assigned to it.
#### Now let us check X, assign letter A If I say type of a sorry type of x str class str, it means it's
#### a string type.
##### That's it.
#### So the variable X doesn't have any type, but the type is changing depending on the value.
##### So you can say that this class is STR.
#### So the str is nothing but the type of a value, not variable.
#### So variable is just a reference.
